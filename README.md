##ExpandCollapsePanel
====================
ExpandCollapsePanel is WinForms control has similar to WPF Expander control. 
Control displays a header that has a collapsible window that displays content. 

There are two projects, the first is the library itself and the second one is a demo application.

ExpandCollapsePanel can be simply used from Form Designer window, you can add controls and expand or collapse panel with smart tags in designer mode directly.

P.S. I think, library is imperfect and incomplete in some respects. But in general, it must meet all the basic requirements for this kind of control as shown in the demo application. For all additional functionality, you can always edit implementation code, it shouldn't be difficult because it is well documented.
